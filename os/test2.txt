its fleace was white as snow
and everywhere that Mary went
the lamb was sure to go
it followed her to school one day
which was against the rules
it made the children laugh and play
to see a lamb at school
and so the teacher turned it out
but still it lingered near
and waited patiently about
till Mary did appear
why does the lamb love Mary so?
the eager children cry
why, Mary loves the lamb, you know
the teacher did reply
